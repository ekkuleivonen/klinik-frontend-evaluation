  Welcome to Klinik's animal shelter. -The space for our employees to share
  their common love towards our furry friends.
</p>

<p>
  Did you know that we have over <span>{{ getDogCount() }}</span> dogs within
  our team?
</p>

<p>
  Yup, we a real bunch of animal lovers over here! We do our best to provide our
  pets with the best homes possible. In fact, we've done so well, that the
  average age of our animals is <span>{{ getAverageAgeOfAnimals() }}</span
  >. That's right, <span>{{ getAverageAgeOfAnimals() }}</span
  >! Do you think an animal would live up to that age in a poor home?
</p>

<p>
  We do our best to maintain a level playing field for our furry friends. But we
  do have our favourites. <span>{{ getMostCommonBreed() }}'s</span> have taken
  the spotlight, and are now the most popular breed in our shelter. What does
  that say about us?
